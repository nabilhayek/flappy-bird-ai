##  Flappy Bird AI using Neuroevolution
This repository contains a Flappy Bird AI implementation that utilizes neuroevolution, artificial intelligence, and evolutionary/genetic algorithms to generate a highly advanced neural network capable of beating the game. The AI starts with no prior knowledge about the game and gradually learns to make accurate decisions based on the game data.

### Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop an AI agent capable of navigating through the Flappy Bird game by avoiding all the pipes. The AI is equipped with a neural network, which undergoes an evolutionary process to optimize its performance. By utilizing neuroevolution and genetic algorithms, the AI's brain evolves over time, resulting in increasingly efficient decision-making capabilities.

### Features and Highlights
**Neuroevolution:** The project leverages neuroevolution techniques to train the AI agent. Through a process inspired by natural selection and genetic algorithms, the neural network's parameters are continually adjusted and refined to improve its performance.

**Artificial Intelligence:** The Flappy Bird AI employs advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to interpret game data and make informed decisions. By analyzing the current game state, the AI determines whether to jump or not, taking into account factors such as pipe positions and the effects of gravity.

**Complex Evolved Brain:** Through the neuroevolution process, the AI's brain evolves into a complex system capable of adapting to various game scenarios. The evolved neural network effectively learns how to navigate the game environment, optimizing its performance over time.
